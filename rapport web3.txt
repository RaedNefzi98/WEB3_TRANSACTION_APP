try npx hardhat test



au dessous de smart_contract:
npm init -y pour générer un packet.json pour notre premier  smart contract





npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms
 to enable the changes in tailwind.config.cjs



steps to create the contract :
crate the metamask account
go to goerli faucet
copy the account
post into the placeholder in the goerli faucet page

after getting some eth coins to test with

go to alchamy and create an account
copy the https address
and go to hardhat.config.js and do the config

now we have a
Transactions.sol under 'contracts' that has thesolidity smartcontract and the contract labels
deploy.js under 'scripts' that has the script to deploy that contract
and hardhat.config.js that has the config necessary for the full transaction 
then:


npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

then we wait for the terminal to give us the address of the deployed contract
check screen'add mtaa l deployed contract'

copy the code '0xe07017013427e25613a817d616d7A5dB7F0447Ad' inside constants.js 



Transactions.json(abi) serves to interact between contracts inside and outside the blockchain and contains all the information about
our smartcontract
